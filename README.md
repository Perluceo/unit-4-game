The famous game of Black Jack or 21 is the underlying premise of Crystal Collector. Instead of counting a
                deck of 52 cards you must
                keep track of the value each crystal possesses to equate the target number. If you exceed the target you
                lose if you meet it you win.
                Good luck!!
